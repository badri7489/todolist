# To Do List
NodeJS and ExpressJS to create a To Do List

You can create a to do list on daily basis, like everyday. From Sunday to Monday. And once an item is done you can strike it off from your list. You can definetly add new to do
in your list.

### Work List
There is also a section for the work list which is seperate from the to do list. Here you can add your work related stuffs. Same as the to do list you can strike off and add new items from the list.
